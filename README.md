# Deep_Learning_Models_Tutorial

This is my personal notes of deep learning models. Since I might want to share my practice expriences in the future, I decided to share the drafts first here.

The tutorials include:

traditional machine learning models:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression

deep learning models:

1. n-gram model
2. RNN
3. RNN-GRU
4. Bidirectional RNN
5. LSTM
6. Bidirectional LSTM
